\chapter{Study about ElasticSearch}
\label{chap:elasticsearch}

\begin{abstract}
	This study intends to confirm that the adoption of \textit{Elasticsearch} as a database solution is feasible. Elasticsearch is a search engine system based on Apache Lucene. Its primary goal is the management of an index of documents. It does not present all the resources that an integral database solution provides. Even so, SERPRO adopted Elasticsearch as the main database solution in the architecture of the Cognitive Computing Project. The present study investigates the limitations and benefits in the use of Elasticsearch as a database.
