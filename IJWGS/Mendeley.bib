	abstract = {We present a new approach to adding closed world reasoning to the Web Ontology Language OWL. It transcends previous work on circumscriptive description logics which had the drawback of yielding an undecidable logic unless severe restrictions were imposed. In particular, it was not possible, in general, to apply local closure to roles. In this paper, we provide a new approach, called grounded circumscrip- tion, which is applicable to SROIQ and other description logics around OWL without these restrictions. We show that the resulting language is decidable, and we derive an upper complexity bound. We also provide a decision procedure in the form of a tableaux algorithm.},

@inproceedings{Muniz2013a,
	abstract = {RESTful Web services have become a popular standard that sees the web hosts as servers that offer resources using the HTTP protocol. The SERIN - Semantic RESTFul Interfaces applies Object Orientation Interfaces paradigm to define conceptual models that describe RESTful services syntactically and semantically. A host that implements an interface offer the specified RESTful services to access resources that are intances of the classes specified in the interface. The SERIN proposal adds annotations in the classes of OWL ontologies to determine which operations (add, modify, delete or retrieve) the RESTful web services must perform. In this paper, the SERIN proposal was simplified and also is presented a full sample program that implements the proposed Semantic RESTFul Interfaces.},
